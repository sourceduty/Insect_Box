***

An interactive box that uses AI to identify insects placed inside it.

### Components:

1. Raspberry Pi (with WiFi capability for software updates and AI model improvements)
2. AI-Powered Camera Module (compatible with Raspberry Pi)
3. LED Lights (for proper illumination of the insects)
4. Removable and Rechargeable Battery Pack
5. LED Screen (to display the identified insect's name and information)
6. Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction
7. Removable SD Card (for image storage)
8. Enclosure Box (with a compartment for inserting insects)
9. Basic electronic components (wires, resistors, switches)

### Instruction Steps:

1. Design and Build the Enclosure:
   - Create a child-friendly, safe box with a compartment to insert insects.
   - Install LED lights inside the compartment for proper illumination.

2. Set Up the Raspberry Pi:
   - Install the Raspberry Pi OS and configure it for the project.
   - Ensure WiFi connectivity for software updates.

3. Camera Module Integration:
   - Connect the AI-Powered Camera Module to the Raspberry Pi.
   - Develop or integrate an existing AI model for insect identification.

4. LED Screen and GUI Development:
   - Connect the LED screen to display the results of the insect identification.
   - Design and implement a simple GUI that children can interact with, displaying information about the identified insect.

5. Power Management:
   - Integrate the removable and rechargeable battery pack to power the box.
   - Include a charging mechanism and battery level indicator on the GUI.

6. Image Capture and Storage:
   - Program the system to capture a series of images once an insect is inserted.
   - Analyze the images and save the optimal ones on the removable SD card.

7. Testing and Validation:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the accuracy of insect identification.
   - Validate the user interface and overall user experience with children.

8. Documentation and Safety Measures:
   - Create user-friendly documentation explaining how to use the Insect Identification Box.
   - Implement safety measures to ensure the box is safe for children to use.

9. Final Assembly:
   - Assemble all components inside the enclosure.
   - Perform final testing to ensure everything works as intended.

10. Deployment:
    - Deploy the Insect Identification Box for educational purposes in schools, museums, or at home.
